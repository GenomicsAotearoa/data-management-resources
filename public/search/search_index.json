This is intended as a resource that sits alongside the manuscript Journeying towards best practice: tips and tricks for improved data management for biodiversity genomics researchers [link]. Content can be used freely to support biodiversity genomic data management. If the manuscript or repository are referred to in research, these should be cited as [MS citation], [GitHub repo citation]. </p> <p>We recognise that biodiversity genomic data management can be challenging, particularly for researchers entering this space, and you may have many questions as you proceed on your journey. The primary goal of this repository is to support biodiversity genomics researchers in developing good data management practices, in line with the FAIR and CARE data stewardship principles. For more on the ethics and benefits of data management, see Module 02. We aim to empower the biodiversity genomics community to minimise risks and maximise research impact now and into the future. We encourage researchers to view data management as a behaviour intrinsic to the research process, and to adopt a mindset of adaptability to the various hurdles you may encounter along the way.</p> <p></p> <p>In this repository we outline four scenarios that illustrate some of the challenges associated with genomic data management. We use these scenarios as examples to demonstrate a diversity of realistic considerations, compromises, and actions for biodiversity genomic data management. While we acknowledge that real life is not typically this tidy, we hope that you may see your own experiences reflected through some combination of these scenarios. While you are likely to relate most strongly with one scenario, we encourage you to peruse all four scenarios to gain a breadth of perspectives across career stages and roles.</p> <p>Based on the questions that arise from these scenarios, we direct you to modules that examine these challenges and provide resources and solutions to help you on your data management journey. While these modules are non-exhaustive, they will be regularly updated as new solutions come to light. </p> <pre><code>graph TD;\n    A[Which scenario most closely reflects \\n your data management journey?] --&gt; B{I am new to the biodiversity \\n genomics research space}\n    B --&gt; |No| E{I am familiar with working across \\n multiple research projects in \\n a collaborative environment}\n    B --&gt; |Yes| D[Scenario 1]\n    E --&gt; |No| G{I am in a leadership position \\n facilitating biodiversity \\n genomics research}\n    E --&gt; |Yes| F[Scenario 2]\n    G --&gt; |No| I{I am acting in a \\n support role to facilitate \\n biodiversity genomics research}\n    G --&gt; |Yes| H[Scenario 3]\n    I --&gt; |No| K[Consider reading all \\n scenarios for an overview]\n    I --&gt; |Yes| J[Scenario 4]\n    click D \"https://genomicsaotearoa.github.io/data-management-resources/scenarios/scenario1\"\n    click F \"https://genomicsaotearoa.github.io/data-management-resources/scenarios/scenario2\"\n    click H \"https://genomicsaotearoa.github.io/data-management-resources/scenarios/scenario3\"\n    click J \"https://genomicsaotearoa.github.io/data-management-resources/scenarios/scenario4\"</code></pre>"},{"location":"modules/","title":"Modules","text":"<p>Here you can find a series of modules filled with tips and tricks to support you on your data management journey.</p> <p>Module 01 - Best practice data management resources</p> <p>Module 02 - The ethics and benefits of good data management practices</p> <p>Module 03 - Designing (and tailoring) data management plans</p> <p>Module 04 - Incorporating Indigenous data sovereignty considerations</p> <p>Module 05 - The what, why and how of metadata management</p> <p>Module 06 - Data management daily - workflow management, version control, and dependency management</p> <p>Module 07 - Helping support staff help you</p> <p>Module 08 - Templates for data management </p> <p>Module 09 - Hot, warm, and cold data storage</p> <p>Module 10 - Decision trees - how can I best manage my data?</p>"},{"location":"scenarios/scenario1/","title":"Scenario 1","text":""},{"location":"scenarios/scenario2/","title":"Scenario 2","text":""},{"location":"scenarios/scenario3/","title":"Scenario 3","text":""},{"location":"scenarios/scenario4/","title":"Scenario 4","text":""}]}

  Large-scale genomic data sets are being generated at an
  unprecedented pace, requiring collaboration across
  disciplines to utilise these data to their full potential.
  We represent a cross-disciplinary team, including IT and
  eResearch support staff, biodiversity genomics
  researchers, and those interested in appropriate data
  stewardship and re-use. Through our experiences, we
  appreciate the need for appropriate data management
  practices not only to minimise the risks of data loss and
  maximise efficiency and productivity for single projects,
  but also to enhance opportunities for future data re-use
  and collaboration. These practices are an essential
  component in facilitating Indigenous data sovereignty and
  are an expectation of the FAIR and CARE principles. Here
  we model good data management practices, and provide tips
  and tricks to support emerging researchers (and research
  teams broadly) in documenting and managing biodiversity
  genomic data sets and associated metadata. We aim to
  empower the biodiversity genomics community to minimise
  risks and maximise research impact now and into the
  future.

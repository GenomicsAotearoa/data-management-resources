        <li>If you don’t understand a workshop the first time around, it’s ok to sign up and do it again!</li>
        <li>There is no such thing as a dumb question. You are more likely to get things wrong if you make assumptions without clarifying. Ask the questions so you can get things right the first time!</li>
        <li>You can learn a lot from working alongside others - organise a hacky group to share solutions and troubleshoot challenges - you will likely find that you will learn shortcuts, quick keys, and handy commands via osmosis.</li>
        <li>We recommend you use programs that can make writing, editing, and running scripts easier, like VS Code.</li>

  * You can learn a lot from working alongside others - organise a hacky group to share solutions and troubleshoot challenges - you will likely find that you will learn shortcuts, quick keys, and handy commands from watching other people work.

  * We recommend you use programs that can make writing, editing, and running scripts easier, like [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

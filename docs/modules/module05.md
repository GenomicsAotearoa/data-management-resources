# Module 05 - Dsta Management Plans in practice

A data management plan (DMP), sometimes referred to as a data management and sharing plan (DMSP), serves to define a framework for how we as researchers use and interact with data under our care. In this Module, weâ€™ll look to our personas for examples of why DMPs are an essential research tool and provide some suggestions to springboard researchers looking to develop their first DMP. 

## The newbie tackling a new project

[Taylor](https://genomicsaotearoa.github.io/data-management-resources/personas/persona1/) is a fresh-eyed PhD student excited to be working on a new project for a culturally significant species. No previous work has been done, so Taylor will need to develop a DMP from scratch. Taylor will work closely with their supervisor, [Professor Nepia](https://genomicsaotearoa.github.io/data-management-resources/personas/persona3/), who holds established relationships with Indigenous communities that have cultural connections with the focal species. To clearly communicate the terms under which the data will be generated, used, and accessed by all parties they need to establish a DMP for this project.

To co-design a DMP that is fit-for-purpose, Professor Nepia leverages her previous experience to balance institutional responsibilities, research objectives, and priorities of Indigenous communities. For instance, the university has a mandate for researchers to provide DMPs, the project aims to generate a large amount of data from hundreds of samples collected at various locations, and Indigenous communities desire to maintain kaitiakitanga. Through conversations between Taylor, Professor Nepia, and key representatives from the Indigenous communities and a government wildlife organisation, Taylor has identified institutional commitments, research requirements, and community needs around the data. They have collated these in a table so they can clearly understand their obligations. 

## Resources for developing a Data Management Plan

DMPs are widely used across the research, science, and innovation sector. As such, there is no need to reinvent the wheel - leverage the wide array of available resources to help you get started! 

### Online data management resources 

The [Digital Curation Centre](https://www.dcc.ac.uk/guidance/how-guides/develop-data-plan) provides useful guides and advice to help you get started.

[MANTRA](https://mantra.ed.ac.uk/) is a free, online non-assessed course with guidelines to help you understand and reflect on how to manage the digital data you collect throughout your research. It has been crafted for the use of post-graduate students, early career researchers, and also information professionals. It is freely available on the web for anyone to explore on their own. 

### Online resources for developing Data Management Plans

Use a checklist to see if you need to create a DMP: https://www.dcc.ac.uk/guidance/how-guides

Check out [10 simple rules for creating a good DMP](https://datamanagement.hms.harvard.edu/plan-design/data-management-plans) which provides useful guidelines on what to include in DMPs. 

To create your own DMP, you can try out the Digital Curation Centre's [Data Management Plan Tool](https://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk/), or the [Data Stewardship Wizard](https://ds-wizard.org/), which is used Horizon Europe and other funding bodies, and which incorporates version control.

### Other ways to learn about Data Management Plans

Attend a course on Data Management at your local institution.

Reach out to your institution's Data Librarian, Data Stewards, or Research Data Management teams for expert assistance and support.

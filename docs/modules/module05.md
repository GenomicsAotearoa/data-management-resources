# Advice on how to plan (From DCC Online Guides - How to Develop a Data Management and Sharing Plan
Consult and collaborate: Think through the different options and seek advice to determine what is best for your context. It is particularly useful to consult on technical aspects as these affect how your project is scheduled, the expertise and applications required, and the methods used to acquire and analyse data. Ask for advice from your colleagues, the library, local IT support, legal advisors, ethics boards, data repositories and more. If needed, also build in specialist support.
Use existing support: Others have addressed these challenges before you, so build on existing models. Data management infrastructure is increasing, particularly within institutions.[6] IT services run established back-up regimes and your research group or department may have local policies and procedures that you can refer to. Support is also available through a variety of disciplinary data centres, repositories and structured databases.[7]
Justify your decisions: Funders tend not to specify particular file formats, standards or methodologies that you are expected to use. You need to choose and demonstrate that the selections made are the most appropriate for your context, that of your discipline and future users. Similarly, you need to present a convincing case for any restrictions on data sharing.
Be prepared to implement your plan:Funders want to see that you understand their requirements and have realistic plans in place to meet these. The description of planned work should be clear and achievable so markers can feel confident that you understand the options and will be able to deliver what is proposed. Clearly defined roles and responsibilities add weight to your plans so be explicit about who will do what, how and when. <italic>https://www.dcc.ac.uk/guidance/how-guides/develop-data-plan#Advice%20on%20how%20to%20plan</italic>

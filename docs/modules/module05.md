A data management plan (DMP), sometimes referred to as a data management and sharing plan (DMSP), serves to define a framework for how we as researchers use and interact with data under our care. In this Module, we’ll look to our personas for examples of why DMPs are an essential research tool and provide some suggestions to springboard researchers looking to develop their first DMP. 

## The newbie tackling a new project

<p>
<img src="https://github.com/GenomicsAotearoa/data-management-resources/blob/main/docs/figures/Taylor-profile.png?raw=true" alt="Profile image of Taylor Smith" style="float:left;height:120px;"> <a href="https://genomicsaotearoa.github.io/data-management-resources/personas/persona1/">Taylor</a> is a fresh-eyed PhD student excited to be working on a new project for a culturally significant species. No previous work has been done, so Taylor will need to develop a DMP from scratch. Taylor will work closely with their supervisor, <a href="https://genomicsaotearoa.github.io/data-management-resources/personas/persona3/">Professor Nepia</a>, who holds established relationships with Indigenous communities that have cultural connections with the focal species. To clearly communicate the terms under which the data will be generated, used, and accessed by all parties they need to establish a DMP for this project. 
</p>

To co-design a DMP that is fit-for-purpose, Professor Nepia leverages her previous experience to balance institutional responsibilities, research objectives, and priorities of Indigenous communities. For instance, the university has a mandate for researchers to provide DMPs, the project aims to generate a large amount of data from hundreds of samples collected at various locations, and Indigenous communities desire to maintain kaitiakitanga. Through conversations between Taylor, Professor Nepia, and key representatives from the Indigenous communities and a government wildlife organisation, Taylor has identified institutional commitments, research requirements, and community needs around the data. They have collated these in a table so they can clearly understand their obligations.

Professor Nepia and Taylor recognise this will be an iterative and collaborative process, requiring regular engagement with the community so all parties are briefed regularly on progress, and to continue conversations to ensure the resulting DMP will serve the intended purpose while being responsive to change. With this information in hand, Taylor and Professor Nepia are now equipped to begin work on developing a DMP that satisfies these needs. 

## The experienced data manager

<p>
<img src="https://github.com/GenomicsAotearoa/data-management-resources/blob/main/docs/figures/Atsushi-profile.png?raw=true" alt="Profile image of Dr Atsushi Sato" style="float:left;height:100px;"> <a href="https://genomicsaotearoa.github.io/data-management-resources/personas/persona2/">Dr Sato</a> is an old hand when it comes to operating under established DMPs. Although he finds data management an onerous part of the research process, he recognises its importance, and has developed skills to help him adhere to DMPs in his daily workflows. He understands that as a middle-man for diverse datasets, it is important that he familiarises himself with access and usage requirements. 
  </p>
  
In Dr Sato’s case, leveraging datasets with different data management requirements is not uncommon. He relies on collaborators to provide a well-defined DMP alongside the data. He is tasked with the role of identifying the practical intersection between technical aspects such as data storage and compute, and governance as determined by existing DMPs. While Taylor and Professor Nepia are concerned with development of a DMP, Dr Sato has to adhere to DMPs that have been defined by collaborators. 

In his role, Dr Sato generates large quantities of intermediate analysis files, and typically hands off data to other collaborators once analysis is complete. He is less concerned with long-term storage requirements, and more with the here-and-now of these datasets. Among these concerns, he observes a shortfall in one of these existing DMPs, that lacks guidance for the potential reuse of key intermediate files. While this small oversight is not the end of the world, he will need to discuss this with his collaborators, who may need to revise this DMP.

## The foundation of a DMP

By having done the background thinking and having discussions around data management for a proposed project you will be well set up to fill in a DMP template. Some examples of aspects that may be covered in a DMP include: 

* Data types
* Data formats and standards
* Data roles and responsibilities
* Data dissemination
* Data sharing & access
* Archiving & persistence

While some funding bodies or institutes may designate specific templates, these are likely to cover fairly similar aspects and can be readily adapted to suit. Considering the [5Ws (+H)](https://github.com/GenomicsAotearoa/data-management-resources/blob/main/docs/figures/5Ws-eResearch-support-staff-draft-v2.png?raw=true) specific to your project should help you to populate any template.


## Resources for developing a Data Management Plan

DMPs are widely used across the research, science, and innovation sector. As such, there is no need to reinvent the wheel - leverage the wide array of available resources to help you get started! 

### Online data management resources 

The [Digital Curation Centre](https://www.dcc.ac.uk/guidance/how-guides/develop-data-plan) provides useful guides and advice to help you get started.

[MANTRA](https://mantra.ed.ac.uk/) is a free, online non-assessed course with guidelines to help you understand and reflect on how to manage the digital data you collect throughout your research. It has been crafted for the use of post-graduate students, early career researchers, and also information professionals. It is freely available on the web for anyone to explore on their own. 

### Online resources for developing Data Management Plans

* Use a checklist to see if you need to create a DMP: https://www.dcc.ac.uk/guidance/how-guides

* Check out [10 simple rules for creating a good DMP](https://datamanagement.hms.harvard.edu/plan-design/data-management-plans) which provides useful guidelines on what to include in DMPs. 

* To create your own DMP, you can try out the Digital Curation Centre's [Data Management Plan Tool](https://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk/), or the [Data Stewardship Wizard](https://ds-wizard.org/), which is used Horizon Europe and other funding bodies, and which incorporates version control.

### Other ways to learn about Data Management Plans

* Attend a course on Data Management at your local institution.

* Reach out to your institution's Data Librarian, Data Stewards, or Research Data Management teams for expert assistance and support.

It is vital to ensure the continuity of data management throughout the research life cycle. Data management is most effective when pursued as a team, with a consistent and cohesive long-term plan and some division of labour. A little effort early in the process can go a long way! Here we highlight two strategies to support research teams in achieving their data management aspirations. 

## Documenting data management guidelines for research teams 

We recommend that research teams develop clear documentation around on/offboarding procedures and daily data management practices. This will streamline the process of joining the team, provide guidance on the options for and constraints around data transfer, storage, and access. This also paves a clear pathway for ongoing access to data, or the packaging of data and metadata for long-term storage upon departure.

Documentation of team guidelines can be hugely beneficial, both for the team leader in setting out expectations, and for members in understanding their obligations. Such guidelines are best co-developed by the team, with team members bringing the knowledge of the day-to-day minutiae required to meet the expectations set out by the team leader, while leaders can provide the deeper understanding of the structural and institutional limitations the team are working within. Further, to ensure balance within the group, it is important for all members to recognise that these expectations can be bi-directional. Not only does the team leader have expectations of conduct and contributions of team members, but team members also will have expectations for their team leader. By clearly documenting these expectations, open conversations can be had at an early stage in the development of these relationships to guide interpersonal interactions among the research group.

We do not intend to dictate what these relationships and interactions should look like, but merely highlight some aspects that research groups may wish to address and clarify in a research team strategy or other documentation, and specifically those aspects pertaining to data management. These aspects may include:

* Clear definition of responsibilities - including data management as a responsibility of all members.
* Description of recommended daily data management practices.
* 'How to' guides for relevant aspects of data management, including: sample tracking, populating inventories, recording and maintaining metadata, data decision-making processes (including access to and use of relevant data storage options across the research life cycle), DMP development, data sharing within the restrictions laid out in those DMPs, and version control and documentation of analysis, and identification of appropriate people to seek advice from across the range of these workflows. 

These guidelines can be documented in a research group manual that clearly lays out onboarding and exiting processes, bi-directional expectations for interpersonal relationships, relevant ethical considerations and expectations, and any institutional requirements that may arise across the research life cycle. Some examples of these include, but are not limited to completion of a student-supervisor agreement, project proposal submission details, applications for human or animal ethics approvals, funding opportunities to support research or conference travel, and key activities and associated dates. 

## Establish a research data management culture in your group

To ensure consistency despite the potential for frequent turnover within the group, we suggest that research teams establish a data management champion to oversee the onboarding and training of new members and ensure the implementation of consistent data management practices across the research team. While anyone can take on this transferable role, a data management champion will ideally have a mid- to long-term position within the research team, hold a deep understanding of the unique characteristics of each research project, and have the necessary level of autonomy to operate independently as a leader in this role. Succession planning for this role will be essential to ensure consistency and continuity. 

This person can also operate as a conduit between the research team and eResearch and libraries staff, and so excellent people skills will be advantageous. By engaging regularly and often with their instituteâ€™s support structures, they can ensure that eResearch and libraries staff are kept up to date with the changing needs of the team, and ensure access to the latest services and support.

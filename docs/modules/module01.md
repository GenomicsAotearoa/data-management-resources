# Module 01 - Top tips and tricks to make data management easy

In this module we outline some tips and tricks that we have found hand for our own research. But it is important to note that every journey is different, with some potential detours! As such, your mileage with these tips may vary.  

## Taylor and Atsushi’s advice for emerging researchers

  <li>If you don’t understand a workshop the first time around, it’s ok to sign up and do it again.</li>
  
  <li>There is no such thing as a dumb question. In fact, someone else is probably wondering the same thing! You are more likely to get things wrong if you make assumptions without clarifying. Ask questions so you can get things right the first time!</li>

  <li>You can learn a lot from working alongside others - organise a hacky group to share solutions and troubleshoot challenges. You will likely find that you will learn shortcuts, quick keys, and handy commands from watching other people work.</li>

  <li>We recommend you use programs that can make writing, editing, and running scripts easier, like <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a>.</li>

  <li> Reach out to your institution's data management experts and support staff for assistance - ideally early in the research lifecycle.</li>
  <li> Avail yourself of the free and widely available research data management resources online. This Hub is a great starting point!</li>
  <li> Learn how to keep your documents and processes under version control (using git and similar tools), and make commits often.</li>
  <li> Give it a go. Start writing a data management plan before you start your research, and ask for help along the way. Practice makes perfect!</li>

## Professor Nepia's advice for research team leaders

Foster a positive data management culture in your group, including:

  <li> Develop clear documentation around on/offboarding procedures and daily management practices</li>
  <li> Make data management a standing item on the agenda for research team meetings</li>
  <li> Support your data management champion(s) in:</li>
    <li> Overseeing the onboarding and identifying training needs for new members to ensure the implementation of consistent data management practices</li>
    <li> Operating as a conduit between the research team and eResearch and libraries staff</li> 
  <li> Embed succession planning across the research team, especially for the data management champion</li>

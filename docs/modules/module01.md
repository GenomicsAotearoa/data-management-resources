# Module 01 - Top tips and tricks to make data management easy

Here are some tips and tricks that we have found useful in our personal research journeys. As every situation is different, your mileage may vary.

  <li>If you don’t understand a workshop the first time around, it’s ok to sign up and do it again.</li> 
  
  <li>There is no such thing as a dumb question. You are more likely to get things wrong if you make assumptions without clarifying. Ask the questions so you can get things right the first time!</li>

  <li>You can learn a lot from working alongside others - organise a hacky group to share solutions and troubleshoot challenges - you will likely find that you will learn shortcuts, quick keys, and handy commands from watching other people work.</li>

  <li>We recommend you use programs that can make writing, editing, and running scripts easier, like <a href="[https://www.w3schools.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/)">Visual Studio Code</a>.</li>

  <li> Reach out to your institution's data management experts and support staff for assistance, preferably before you embark on the research.</li>
  <li> Avail yourself of the free and widely available research data management resources online. This Hub is a great starting point!</li>
  <li> Learn how to keep your documents and processes under version control (using git and similar tools), and make commits often.</li>
  <li> Give it a go. Start writing a data management plan before you start your research, and ask for help on the way. Practice makes perfect!</li>

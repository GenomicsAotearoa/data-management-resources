# Module 02 - The ethics and benefits of good data management practices

Effective data management not only helps make you more efficient and your research more reproducible, it can also mitigate the ever-present risk of data misuse. Misuse can range anywhere in severity from accidentally sharing data without authorisation to cherry-picking of data and outright theft. The consequences of data misuse are infectious and can extend beyond an individual to the research group, collaborators, and their institutes in the form of serious legal implications, reputational risk, and negative impacts on career trajectories. On a broader level still, data misuse is harmful to the integrity of the research, science, and innovation sector, and has important social implications relating to public trust in science.  

We're not intending to be dramatic by pointing out these consequences and we're not aiming to fearmonger researchers into data management. Rather, we hope to share some of the potential risk and consequences and enable researchers to mitigate these risks in their own data management practices. This is because the relative risks of misuse can vary throughout the research life cycle and there are relatively few ethical frameworks established for the generation and storage of biodiversity genomic data (especially eDNA, plants, invertebrates, fungi).  

As a result, researchers and eResearch staff must equip themselves with diverse strategies to mitigate risks in a variety of situations. However we recognise that there remains a gap between knowing and doing, with different groups positioned at different points on their data management journeys. 

While it is easy to envision the consequences of data misuse, what are the incentives to upholding good data management practices?

* Good data management minimises the risks of data misuse, loss, or theft, improves transparency, and ensures data FAIRness within established parameters specific to those data.
* Good data management benefits the researcher through increased efficiency and greater opportunities for and outcomes of collaborations, with flow-on effects that contribute to accelerate career trajectories.  
* Good data management makes life easy!  

We encourage researchers to view data management practices as behaviours intrinsic to the research process, and to adopt a mindset of adaptability to the various hurdles that may be encountered along the way.

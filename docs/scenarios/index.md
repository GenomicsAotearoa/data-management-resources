# Scenario overview

Here we present four scenarios that describe some of the key questions and concerns associated with genomic data management across a diversity of career stages and roles across the research ecosystem. We hope that you are able to relate to some of the challenges experienced by the characters in their data management journeys. To gain a broad understanding across various perspectives, we recommend investigating all four scenarios.

[Scenario 1](https://genomicsaotearoa.github.io/data-management-resources/scenarios/scenario1/) - A student new to biodiversity genomics 

[Scenario 2](https://genomicsaotearoa.github.io/data-management-resources/scenarios/scenario2/) - An early career researcher working collaboratively outside of academia 

[Scenario 3](https://genomicsaotearoa.github.io/data-management-resources/scenarios/scenario3/) - A biodiversity genomics research team leader

[Scenario 4](https://genomicsaotearoa.github.io/data-management-resources/scenarios/scenario4/) - An eResearch support staff member

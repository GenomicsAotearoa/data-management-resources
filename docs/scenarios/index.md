# Scenarios

Here we present four scenarios to help you identify key questions and concerns associated with genomic data management across a diversity of career stages and roles. We hope that you are able to relate to some of the challenges experienced by the characters in their data management journeys. To gain an understanding across broad perspectives, we recommend investigating all four scenarios.

[Scenario 1](https://genomicsaotearoa.github.io/data-management-resources/scenarios/scenario1/) - An early career biodiversity genomics researcher

[Scenario 2](https://genomicsaotearoa.github.io/data-management-resources/scenarios/scenario2/) - A researcher working outside of academia across a range of highly collaborative projects

[Scenario 3](https://genomicsaotearoa.github.io/data-management-resources/scenarios/scenario3/) - A research team leader

[Scenario 4](https://genomicsaotearoa.github.io/data-management-resources/scenarios/scenario4/) - An eResearch support staff member

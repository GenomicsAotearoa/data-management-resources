# Scenario overview

Here we describe four personas across a diversity of career stages and roles within the research ecosystem. These are based on our personal data management journeys, and we use these to describe some of the key questions and concerns associated with genomic data management. We hope that you are able to relate to some of the challenges experienced by the characters in their data management journeys. To gain a broad understanding across various perspectives, we recommend investigating all four personas.

[Persona 1](https://genomicsaotearoa.github.io/data-management-resources/personas/persona1/) - A student new to biodiversity genomics 

[Persona 2](https://genomicsaotearoa.github.io/data-management-resources/personas/persona2/) - An early career researcher working collaboratively outside of academia 

[Persona 3](https://genomicsaotearoa.github.io/data-management-resources/personas/persona3/) - A biodiversity genomics research team leader

[Persona 4](https://genomicsaotearoa.github.io/data-management-resources/personas/persona4/) - An eResearch support staff member

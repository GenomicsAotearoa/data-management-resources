# Introduction

Welcome to the genomic data management repository! We recognise that biodiversity genomic data management can be a challenge, particularly for researchers entering this space, and you may have many questions as you proceed on your journey. The primary goal of this repository is to support biodiversity genomics researchers in developing good data management practices that embody the [FAIR](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/) and [CARE](https://www.gida-global.org/care) data stewardship principles, as described in the article cited below. For more on the ethics and benefits of data management, see [Module 02](https://genomicsaotearoa.github.io/data-management-resources/modules/module02/). We aim to empower the biodiversity genomics community to minimise risks and maximise research impact now and into the future. We encourage researchers to view data management as a behaviour intrinsic to the research process, and to adopt a mindset of adaptability to the various hurdles you may encounter along the way.

In this repository we draw on our personal experiences to outline [four scenarios](https://genomicsaotearoa.github.io/data-management-resources/scenarios/) that illustrate challenges associated with genomic data management. We use these scenarios as examples to demonstrate a diversity of realistic considerations, compromises, and actions for biodiversity genomic data management. While we acknowledge that real life is not typically this tidy, we hope that you may see your own experiences reflected through some combination of these scenarios. While you are likely to relate most strongly with one scenario, we encourage you to peruse all four scenarios to gain a breadth of perspectives across career stages and roles.

Based on the questions that arise from these scenarios, we direct you to [modules](https://genomicsaotearoa.github.io/data-management-resources/modules/) that examine these challenges and provide resources and solutions to help you on your data management journey. While these modules are non-exhaustive, they will be regularly updated as new solutions come to light.

!!! info "Good practice v. best practice" 

    Here we recognise there are different standards of data management. We acknowledge that ‘gold standard’ best practice is aspirational, and may only be achievable under ideal scenarios. However, achieving ‘gold standard’ best practice as such may not always be practical/practicable/achievable within the constraints of a research project due to external factors. Instead, we prefer to encourage researchers to pursue ‘good practice’ data management, as an achievable goal, as a stepping stone along the journey towards the gold standard.

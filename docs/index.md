# Introduction

Welcome to the Biodiversity Genomic Data Management Hub! We recognise that biodiversity genomic data management can be a challenge, particularly for researchers entering this space, and you are likely to have many questions as you proceed on your journey. The primary goal of this repository is to support biodiversity genomic researchers in developing good data management practices that embody the [FAIR](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/) and [CARE](https://www.gida-global.org/care) Guiding Principles, as described in <a href="#citation-licensing">Citation & Licensing.</a>

!!! info "Good practice versus best practice" 

    Here we recognise there are different standards of data management. We acknowledge that achieving best practices is aspirational, and may not always be practicable within the constraints of a research project due to external factors (see [Personas](https://genomicsaotearoa.github.io/data-management-resources/personas/)). Instead, we encourage researchers to pursue ‘good practices’ as a stepping stone on the journey towards best practices. 

In this hub we leverage our personal data management experiences to describe [four user experience personas](https://genomicsaotearoa.github.io/data-management-resources/personas/) across the research ecosystem that illustrate some of the challenges associated with genomic data management. We use these personas as examples to demonstrate a diversity of the realistic considerations, compromises, and actions for biodiversity genomic data management. While we acknowledge that real life is not typically this tidy, we hope that you may see your own experiences reflected through some combination of these personas. While you are likely to relate most strongly with one persona, we encourage you to peruse all four personas to gain a breadth of perspectives across career stages and roles.

!!! question "Who are we?"
    
    We are a cross-institutional, interdisciplinary, multi-career stage collaborative team based in Aotearoa New Zealand. This team includes biodiversity genomics researchers, institutional and national eResearch and libraries staff, and those with interests in the inclusion of Indigenous perspectives pertaining to biodiversity genomic data. Together we have extensive experience in overseeing biodiversity genomic research projects, curating and managing biodiversity genomic datasets, developing project-specific data management plans (DMPs), and providing data management solutions to research groups. We have lived experience with the caveats of applying data management theory to real-life research situations.

Based on the questions that arise from these personas, we direct you to [modules](https://genomicsaotearoa.github.io/data-management-resources/modules/) that examine these challenges in more detail and provide resources and solutions to help you on your data management journey. While these modules are non-exhaustive, they will be regularly updated as new solutions come to light. 

Through this hub, we aim to empower the biodiversity genomics community to minimise risks and maximise research impact now and into the future. We encourage researchers to view data management as a behaviour intrinsic to the research process, and to adopt a mindset of adaptability to the various hurdles you may encounter along the way.

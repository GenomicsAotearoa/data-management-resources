# Persona 3

## Research group leader Professor Tehara Nepia

Professor Tehara Nepia is a principal investigator at a university overseeing a conservation genomics research team including postgraduate students (including [Taylor](https://genomicsaotearoa.github.io/data-management-resources/personas/persona1/)), postdoctoral researchers, and research associates. Her focus is on designing, facilitating, and disseminating research, and providing a supportive environment that produces highly-skilled emerging researchers well-equipped to contribute to the research, science, and innovation sector. Professor Nepia also places strong emphasis on building and maintaining trusted relationships with research partners, collaborators (including [Dr Sato]((https://genomicsaotearoa.github.io/data-management-resources/personas/persona1/))), and end-users. A substantial part of her role includes seeking and managing funding and resources (including compute and data storage) for the research group. 

As the volume of data generated by Professor Nepia’s research team is continually expanding, there is a growing need to ensure a smooth transition of data (including metadata) between members of her team. While Professor Nepia has a  responsibility to uphold institutional requirements around data management, she is also committed to embedding data management practices that facilitate Indigenous data sovereignty and uphold the FAIR and CARE Guiding Principles. She is working towards a DMP template for use across all her research team's projects. To achieve this, Professor Nepia encourages open two-way communication with her research team to gain their perspectives of the needs and challenges associated with data management. She relies upon her research team to adhere to the DMPs, to support and encourage each other to do this, and to seek strategic advice from her when needed. Beyond the DMPs, Professor Nepia and her team co-develop research team guidelines that include data management processes to streamline team on/offboarding, allowing new members to quickly get up to speed, and providing clear expectations of data management for those departing. 

To ensure workflows are aligned with best practice, she also engages with colleagues in similar situations nationally and internationally, including her disciplinary research community. Keeping abreast of evolving best practices in the research community and updating the research team's DMP accordingly is an added pressure on Professor Nepia’s limited time; she never feels completely up-to-date with the latest developments but understands she must be the one in the research team to lead data management practices even if she is only able to support ‘good’ versus ‘best’ practice. 

To help with this burden, Professor Nepia prioritises building strong relationships with local eResearch and libraries staff (including [Darryl]((https://genomicsaotearoa.github.io/data-management-resources/personas/persona4/))) that are based on transparent, timely, bi-directional communication. Through knowledge-sharing, eResearch and libraries staff help her to understand local data management capacity and constraints, and gain the necessary understanding of the project-specific nuances that enable delivery of wrap-around solutions that support the needs of the research team now and into the future.

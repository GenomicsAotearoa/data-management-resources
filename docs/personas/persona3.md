# Persona 3

## Research group leader Professor Tehara Nepia

Professor Tehara Nepia is a principal investigator at a university overseeing a conservation genomics research group including postgraduate students (including [Taylor](https://genomicsaotearoa.github.io/data-management-resources/personas/persona1/)), postdoctoral researchers, and research associates. Her focus is on designing, facilitating, and disseminating research, and providing a supportive environment that produces highly-skilled emerging researchers well-equipped to contribute to the research, science, and innovation sector. Professor Nepia also places strong emphasis on building and maintaining trusted relationships with research partners, collaborators (including [Dr Sato]((https://genomicsaotearoa.github.io/data-management-resources/personas/persona1/))), and end-users. A substantial part of her role includes seeking and managing funding and resources (including compute and data storage) for the research group. 

As the volume of data generated by Professor Nepia’s team is continually expanding, there is a growing need to ensure a smooth transition of data (including metadata) between members of her research group. While Professor Nepia has a  responsibility to uphold institutional requirements around data management, she is also committed to embedding data management practices that are in line with FAIR and CARE principles. She is working towards a DMP template for use across all her research group’s projects. To achieve this, Professor Nepia encourages open two-way communication with her research group to gain their perspectives of the needs and challenges associated with data management. She relies upon her research group to adhere to the DMPs, to support and encourage each other to do this, and to seek strategic advice from her when needed. Beyond the DMPs, Professor Nepia and her team co-develop research group guidelines that include data management processes to streamline group on/offboarding, allowing new members to quickly get up to speed, and providing clear expectations of data management for those departing. 

To ensure workflows are aligned with best practice, she also engages with colleagues in similar situations nationally and internationally, including her disciplinary research community. Keeping abreast of evolving best practices in the research community and updating the research group’s DMP accordingly is an added pressure on Professor Nepia’s limited time; she never feels completely up-to-date with the latest developments but understands she must be the one in the research group to lead data management practices even if she is only able to support ‘good’ versus ‘best’ practice. To help with this burden, Professor Nepia prioritises building strong relationships with local eResearch and library support staff (including [Darryl]((https://genomicsaotearoa.github.io/data-management-resources/personas/persona4/))) that are based on transparent, timely, bi-directional communication. Through knowledge-sharing, eResearch and library support staff help her to understand local data management capacity and constraints, and gain the necessary understanding of the project-specific nuances that enable delivery of wrap-around solutions that support the needs of the research group now and into the future.

# Personas overview

Here we describe four fictional user-experience personas and their associated data management needs. These personas cover a diversity of career stages and roles within the research ecosystem, and are loosely based on our personal data management journeys. We use these to highlight some of the key questions and challenges associated with biodiversity genomic data management. We hope that you will find aspects of these personas relatable. To gain a broad understanding of the various perspectives, we recommend taking a look at all four personas.

[Persona 1](https://genomicsaotearoa.github.io/data-management-resources/personas/persona1/) - A student new to biodiversity genomics 

[Persona 2](https://genomicsaotearoa.github.io/data-management-resources/personas/persona2/) - An early career researcher working collaboratively

[Persona 3](https://genomicsaotearoa.github.io/data-management-resources/personas/persona3/) - A biodiversity genomics research team leader

[Persona 4](https://genomicsaotearoa.github.io/data-management-resources/personas/persona4/) - An eResearch staff member
